Basic gameplay

- [ ] child buildings consume mana each time they "produce"
- [x] seed mapgen and pick some good seeds
- [x] show lines between mana forge and child buidings
- [x] chain react child buildings when mana forge is blown up

Building placement

- [ ] disable invalid buttons (i.e. not enough resources)
- [x] make sure building sprites are centered on grid coords
- [x] display empty mana line while placing units (to closest parent)
- [x] place buildings only when in range of a mana forge

Victory conditions

- [ ] add city to defend - chain of mana forges from this building
- [ ] add victory condition when fire is out
- [ ] add defeat condition when fire burns target

Fire sim

- [ ] slow it all down, using moisture but with more fuel

Juice

- [ ] animated mana forge

Polish

- [ ] menu rejig - show a fire in the background, buttons down the bottom
- [ ] music
