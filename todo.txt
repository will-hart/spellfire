Polish

1.- [ ] BALANCE
  - [x] if you sequence buildings incorrectly you can get stuck (i.e. not enough for a lumber mill, not enough mana)
        potential solution - set initial lumber to low enough that you can't buy a mana forge? or maybe enough for one of each
  - [ ] wind can make story mode too easy / too hard (should be controlled by scenario?)
  - [ ] Make scenarios balanced and winnable in a few different ways
- [ ] more building types
  - [x] wind mage
  - [x] water golem
6.- [ ] More scenarios
- [x] In story mode - zoom to city hall at the start of the game
- [x] is wind even working?
- [x] menu rejig
  - [x] tutorial on the main page
  - [x] buttons down the bottom
- [x] music
  - [x] title
  - [x] gameplay
    - [x] track 1 - musescore
    - [x] track 2 - Some more dramatic "its burning" tune
- [x] lumber mills can also plant trees in grass

Probably out of scope for jam

- [ ] show wind vane in the UI rather than text
- [ ] main menu - show a fire in the background or something a bit more interesting
- [ ] redraw map without respawning sprites (see map::redraw_map system) - possibly use a texture?
- [ ] fast forward / time acceleration
- [ ] animated buildings
  - [ ] including animated child building detonation

Bugs

- [ ] Storm mage doesn't seem to work?
- [x] Resources don't reset when hitting "M" for new endless mode map
- [x] can place buildings off the map
- [x] Minotaur right on the edge of the map has out of bounds issue when moving
- [x] GAME BREAKING EXPLOIT: terrain underneath a mana forge or city hall can be turned to dirt, meaning it cannot be destroyed
